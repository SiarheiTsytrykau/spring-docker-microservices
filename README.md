# spring-docker-microservices

How to start all microservices:

1. Install Docker Desktop and set memory for Docker Desktop to 7GB 
    Click in tray 'docker icon' -> Settings -> Resources
    A minimum of 4GB RAM assigned to Docker (https://elk-docker.readthedocs.io/#prerequisites) 

2. run via bash (eg. https://cmder.net/):
      sh build.sh
   it will build whole the project and will create docker-image 'javafilebeat:latest' locally     

3. run docker-compose up

After the services started in 2-4 minutes check the URLs:
  Eureka            http://localhost:8761/
  Kibana            http://localhost:5601/
  Spring Boot Admin http://localhost:8082/
  Client service    http://localhost:8080/test
